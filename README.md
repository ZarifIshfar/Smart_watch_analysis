# Smart_watch_analysis
Performing Data analysis on smart watches

As a final project for my course on Data analysis, I was tasked with answering two questions for a new smart watch company.

The first was about the customer preferences on which watch they would purchase. Based on price and functions, I was tasked with providing them information about which watch they should focus more on.

The second was about a possible issue with the watches, pertaining to poor performance based on skin tone. I was tasked with determining if the watches perform differently based on skin tone of the cutomer.
